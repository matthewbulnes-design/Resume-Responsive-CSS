    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      AWS Unified Standard is a Cloud FinOps project I worked on during my internship at NextEra Energy. This project was to improve the accuracy
      and consistency of AWS budgeting strandards across the organization. The goal was to create one unified budgeting
      standard that multiple teams could follow instead of using different methods.

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Interviewed and gathered requirements from <strong>8 different FinOps teams</strong> to understand how each team
        forecasted and budgeted AWS cloud spend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built an <strong>Excel evaluation matrix</strong> to compare each team’s budgeting process, including strengths,
        weaknesses, and gaps that affected accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identified patterns across teams and used the findings to propose a <strong>standard budgeting framework</strong>
        teams can follow for a more accurate company-wide budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reviewed AWS Savings Plans to optimize investments and assessed tools that could improve Savings Plan optimization.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools and Methods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Excel (matrix scoring, comparison, documentation)</li>
      <li>Stakeholder interviews and requirements gathering</li>
      <li>FinOps criteria-based evaluation</li>
      <li>AWS cost concepts (budgeting, forecasting, Savings Plans)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Outcome / Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The project supported a clearer, standardized approach for budgeting AWS cloud spend across teams.
      This reduces differences between budgeting styles and supports a more consistent and accurate forecast.
