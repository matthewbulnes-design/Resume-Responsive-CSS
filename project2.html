    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      For a HostPenny infrastructure initiative, I conducted a financial feasibility and cost-benefit analysis
      to evaluate transitioning from a physical server environment to a virtualized infrastructure. The existing
      environment consisted of 25,000 physical servers across four groups supporting mission-critical and
      non-mission-critical applications and backups. Utilization rates were low, while power consumption and
      operational overhead were high, making the current environment cost-prohibitive.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The physical server environment generated significant ongoing costs from maintenance, power usage,
      and administrative labor. To support an informed decision, I analyzed both the current and proposed
      environments using 5-year projections and categorized expenses into hard costs (hardware, power,
      maintenance) and soft costs (server administration and backup).
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Current physical environment (5-year total):</strong> $4,087,238,507.34</li>
      <li><strong>Proposed virtualized environment (5-year total):</strong> $3,377,202,492.93</li>
      <li>
        The proposed virtualized environment included an initial investment of <strong>$120.47 million</strong>
        in new servers and software, plus ongoing operational costs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis showed that proceeding with virtualization would generate approximately <strong>$710 million</strong>
      in savings over five years, representing a <strong>17.4% reduction</strong> in overall infrastructure costs.
      The primary savings came from reduced power usage and lower server administration costs due to improved
      utilization of virtual servers. Overall, the long-term benefits outweighed the initial investment.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommendation</h2>
    <p>
      Based on the projected cost savings and efficiency improvements, I recommended that HostPenny proceed
      with the virtualization project. This initiative reduces operational expenses, streamlines server management,
      and supports sustainable growth over the next five years.
